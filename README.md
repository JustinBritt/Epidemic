# Epidemic
Mixed-Mode Simulation with agent-based, system-dynamic and discrete event, all working together on top of Sage and other open sourced software.

## Problem Statement
This body of work is intended as an exploration & demo of how one might combine discrete event simulation with agent-based modeling and Simulation Dynamics, all on top of open sourced data and software.
